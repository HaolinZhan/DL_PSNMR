# DL_PSNMR
This file is related to the paper "Accelerated Pure Shift NMR Spectroscopy with Deep Learning" published in Analytical Chemistry (DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04007) by Haolin Zhan et al.
Herein, we present a proof-of-concept of deep learning for fast, high-quality, and reliable pure shift NMR reconstruction, dubbed as DL_PSNMR.
The original code scripts, trained models, as well as the example datasets are contained in this repository.
